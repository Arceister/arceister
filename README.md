# Hey there! Jagad here ðŸ‘‹

Honestly, I don't know what to write here, but here's a summary about me.

Currently, I'm an Integration and Automation Engineer (API Gateway) at IT Group. I'm interested on becoming a Software Engineer that creates clean and robust code, but my daily job consists of Infrastructure Engineering. So why don't I became both?
